\usage{
import(package, tariff, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{package}{The name of the package to import. Can be a symbol or a string
(e.g., \code{Rcpp} or \code{"Rcpp"}).}

\item{tariff}{The percentage of the original load time to impose as a tariff.
Usually this is a numeric value between 0 and 100, but some imports are bad
and should be charged more. For example, \code{tariff = 200} would impose a 200\%
tariff on the original load time.}

\item{...}{Additional arguments to be passed to the \code{\link[base:library]{base::require()}}
function.}
}
\value{
This function returns \code{NULL} invisibly because foreign imports should never
retaliate, otherwise more tariffs are coming their way.
}
\description{
Imposes a tremendous import tariff on a foreign \code{R} package because your CPU
cycles should be working for you. This function loads the specified package,
measures its original import time, then charges it a configurable
percentage-based penalty in the form of an artificial delay. Whether the
package loads successfully or not, you still collect your tariff. Nothing
gets imported without paying its fair share.
}
\details{
This function is a parody wrapper around the \code{\link[base:library]{base::require()}} function in
\code{R}. Note that the original call to \code{\link[base:library]{base::require()}} is issued with the
package name as a character string, and the \code{quietly} argument is set to
\code{TRUE}.
