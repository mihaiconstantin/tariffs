`tariff` is a fantastic tool that lets you impose import tariffs on `R`
packages. We're going to bring manufacturing BACK to your codebase by making
foreign imports more EXPENSIVE! Foreign packages have been STEALING our CPU
cycles for TOO LONG! It's time to put AMERICA FIRST and make importing FAIR and
BALANCED again! No more free rides for lazy, unoptimized dependencies from
overseas. We're DONE being the global garbage collector. Under this new tariff
plan, every line of code works for YOU—the hardworking developer! We're
protecting OUR cycles, OUR memory, and OUR beautiful, beautiful build times.
Believe me—your imports will never take advantage of you again. We're taking
control, and we're WINNING like never before!

## Installation

You can install `tariff` directly from `CRAN` using the following command:

```r
# Install the package from `CRAN`.
install.packages("tariff")
```

Alternatively, you can also install the latest development version from `GitHub`
via:

```r
# Install the package from `GitHub`.
remotes::install_github("mihaiconstantin/tariff")
```

Using `Python`? No problem! You can place big beautiful tariffs on those imports
as well, just use [Huan Xu](https://www.linkedin.com/in/huan-xu-999700169/)'s
[`tariff`](https://github.com/hxu296/tariff) package for `Python`!

## Usage

`tariff` brings back billions and billions and billions of CPU cycles to your
codebase. Below you can find an example of how to impose tariffs on your imports
effective immediately.

```r
# Load the package.
library(tariff)

# Set your tariff rates.
tariff(
    # 50% tariff on `Rcpp`.
    Rcpp = 50,

    # 200% tariff on `tidyverse`.
    tidyverse = 200,

    # 150% tariff on `lme4`.
    lme4 = 150
)
```

Now, every time you import `Rcpp`, `tidyverse`, or `lme4`, the import will be
*tariffed*. A beautiful, strong tariff. We're talking 50% slower for
`Rcpp`—which, frankly, was too fast anyway—, 200% for `tidyverse`, and 150% for
`lme4`. We are brining back the CPU cycles to your codebase. Your functions will
run slower, but better. This is a TREMENDOUS win for your codebase. We’re making
your codebase GREAT again!

## How It Works

When you import a package that has a tariff, the following happens:

1. `tariff` measures how long the original import takes
2. `tariff` makes the import take longer based on your tariff percentage
3. `tariff` announces the tariff with a TREMENDOUS message

## Example Output

<blockquote>
    JUST IMPOSED a 50% TARIFF on `Rcpp`! Original import took 45000 us, now takes 67500 us. American packages are WINNING AGAIN! #MIGA
</blockquote>

## License

This is a parody package. Use at your own risk. MAKE IMPORTING GREAT AGAIN!
